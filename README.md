# jsGizmos

jsGizmos is a sublime plugin that wraps some useful Javascript macros, tools, etc.  Plan to add more as I go.



### SQL to JS String
Copying SQL Queries to be used in JS is a pain, having to wrap each line in quotes followed by a "+".  SQL to JS does that for you.  Highlight the text you want to wrap, hit Ctrl+Shift+l, and you're good to go.
